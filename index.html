    <h2>Proposition: Higher availability of abortion clinics increases frequency with which individuals get abortions</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="pro_stance_vis.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Relationship between clinic accessibility and abortion rates.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Not removing any outliers:  1.5. Since upon initial inspection, it didn't seem like any outliers were significantly affecting the trend line, I decided to not transform 
					the data in any way. I think this worked well as a clear pro-stance trend emerges and the need to not include any transformations enhances perceived trustworthiness of the graphic.
				</li>
				<li>Including a trendline: 1. Including a bright red trendline drives home the positive relationship between abortion rates per 100 women and availability of abortion clinics and 
					makes the trend a lot more obvious to spot upon first glance, enhancing its persuasiveness.
				</li>
				<li>Unbiased Title: 2. The title objectively states the relationship we are exploring without making any observations on the graph itself. I was considering making the title 
					state the positive correlation between the 2 variables but I decided not to, as the trendline speaks for itself and having the graphic itself include no judgements makes it seem more 
					objective to the reader.
				</li>
				<li>Making all data points visible: 2. Including the trendline without the datapoints would call into question how many data points there are, and whether outliers are skewing results. Including 
					all the datapoints increases the transparency of the visualization, and the datapoints don't make the graphic more confusing and harder to read. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="anti_stance_vis_3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Relationship between clinic accessibility and average number of abortions
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using average numbers of abortions, and using raw numbers instead of abortion rates: -1.5. This is deceptive as states have vastly different populations (therefore numbers of abortions), and binning different states together
					is quite deceptive as a populous state affects the average more than multiple less populous states. I chose to do this as it is easier to obscure misleading information under the guise of being objective,
					because 'average number of abortions' seems like an objective metric to the reader. 
				<li>Filtering outliers: - 2. While filtering outliers is usually good practice, filtering out outliers by number of abortions excluded some important states like California 
					that were likely to be outliers due to their population. While there was still no correlation before the filtering, I chose to do this as it made the bars a lot closer together, 
				reinforcing the notion that there is no correlation. </li>
				<li>Binning states by clinic availability: -1. Each bin has a different number of states (for example, there are more states in the 76% - 100% category than in any other category),
						therefore some bins represent the average of far more states than others. I decided on this purposefully, as it makes the analysis more murky without outwardly seeming so.</li>
				<li>Axis title: -0.5. While the title itself simply states the lack of correlation found in the (albeit deceptive) graph, having a leading title like this definitely guides
					the viewer to a conclusion. I chose to include this to drive home the notion that the proposition doesn't hold true upon first glance.</li>
				<li>Color gradient: 1. The color of the bar corresponds to its height. Alternatively, I was considering making each bar a different color, but I 
					decided that using a gradient reinforced that there was no correlation because the user would see a jumble of colors and no clear gradient. I think it worked well
					but wasn't essential to the persuasiveness of the graphic, as it is quite clear on its own. 
				</li>	
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		I think both visualizations were a success and both are persusive for and against the stance respectively without deception being immediately obvious. I 
		was purposely trying to make one of the visualizations more deceptive than the other to distort trends that were more apparent in the data, and I learned 
		that creating deceptive visualizations that have the guise of transparency is difficult and is an art in and of itself. I think that using methods such as removing 
		outliers without disclosing them can be a powerful method to eliminate or reverse trends seen in data, and removal of outliers should be used with great discretion. 
		At times, it was difficult to bin and modify the data so trends emerged and were obscured, and I explored several different propositions (most unsuccessfully). 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	Overall, I think the bounds between acceptable persuasive choices and misleading ones can be drawn based on the intention behind the visualization and the potential impact on the audience. 
	Acceptable persuasion aids understanding without distorting facts, while misleading tactics distort the viewer's perception, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions.
	Factors such as truncating axes, excluding relevant data, or using emotive language can be misleading.
	The distinction often lies in whether the design serves to inform (with any analysis written after the graphic has been created) or to deceive for the benefit of a particular argument.
